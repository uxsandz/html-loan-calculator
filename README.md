# Loan Interest Rate Calculator

A simple Loan Interest Rate Calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool calculates the total interest and final repayment amount for a loan based on the current prime rate, loan amount, and loan term.

## Features

4. The results are displayed on the page.
